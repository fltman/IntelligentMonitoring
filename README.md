```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
```

### Database Setup

The application will automatically create the necessary database tables on first run. Make sure your PostgreSQL database is accessible using the provided DATABASE_URL.

## Prompt Configuration

The application uses several AI prompts for different purposes. Here's how to configure each type:

### 1. Interest Prompt

Used to filter articles based on relevance. The prompt should describe the topics and themes of interest.

Example:
```
Focus on articles related to:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Tech industry news and innovations
- Startup ecosystem and funding
- Developer tools and platforms

Exclude:
- General consumer tech reviews
- Gaming news
- Personal tech blogs
```

### 2. Summary Prompt

Defines how articles should be summarized. Include specific instructions about length, style, and focus.

Example:
```
Create a concise summary that:
- Captures the main argument or finding
- Includes key statistics or data points
- Highlights industry implications
- Keeps length between 2-3 paragraphs
- Uses professional, objective tone
- Avoids technical jargon
```

### 3. Newsletter Template

Template for generating newsletters. Use markdown formatting and placeholders for dynamic content.

Example:
```markdown
# Tech Insights Weekly
${date}

## Top Stories This Week

${articles_summary}

## Industry Analysis

${analysis}

## Quick Takes
${quick_takes}

---
*Curated by AI, reviewed by humans. Stay informed!*
```

### 4. Podcast Studio Prompt

Defines the podcast format, characters, and style. Must include host definitions with ElevenLabs voice IDs.

Example:
```json
{
  "podcast": {
    "title": "TechTalk Weekly",
    "episode": "42",
    "theme": "The Future of AI in Daily Life",
    "hosts": [
